1.How do I approach designing software?

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
- I have learned how to picture 3-D objects and their relationships to each other in reference to a cartesian coodinate system. 
I also learned how to apply textures and colors to objects in the 3D space.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
- I just tried to use the plane in my scene as the reference point for the rest of the objects. Based on the y-axis value of the plane I just had to make sure 
any of the other object that where resting on the 2D-plane had higher y-axis values.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
- I think using an initial object as the reference point for other objects was very helpful. I feel if I was able to visualize the coordinate system in the rendering, 
that would have helped me figure out the placement of these objects a lot easier.

2.How do I approach developing programs?

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
- I created methods to simplify code that kept being repeated in the rendering. I also would build and debug my code often to make sure any changes I made that 
I was not 100% sure about, would not make debugging these changes harder then nesessary.
- When developing my scene I used a lot of trial and error, also a lot of reading and research to get the code working efficeintly 

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
- Iteration was a key approach in building out the project. If I tried to solve all the issues and requirements at once it would have been too overwhelming for sure. 
Making small changes and testing them made develoment a lot clearer and easier to understand.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
- At first I just tried to solve the requirements all at once, this often lead to confusion. Once I learned how to approach each requirement separatly and iterate on that requirement, 
coding became a lot easier to manage.

3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
- My work on computational graphics and visualizations helped me learn how to approach problems in an interative way. Also my work helped me visualize 3D spaces in 
a cartessian coodinate system better.
**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
- My work on computational graphics and visualizations will help me tremendously in my future work because it taught me that although things may seem overwhelming at first, they can 
be managed and learned as long as I keep working on the issues and take small sections of the code at a time to understand how things fit together.
